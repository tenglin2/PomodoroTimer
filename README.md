# PomodoroTimer

### Overview
This is a simple Pomodoro Timer project coded in JavaScript. I wanted to learn how JavaScript can handle timed events to I tested it with this implementation.

### Features
- Dynamic timing selections
- Responsive start, reset, and edit buttons
- Functional timing component

### Languages
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Notes
Most timers have a sound notification when the timer runs out. I was not able to implement sound in the time given. But I'll reconsider and probably add it when I come back to this project.
